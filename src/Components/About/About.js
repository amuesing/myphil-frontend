                What is Classical Music
            </div>
            <section>
            The term "classical music" generally refers to music written for a group of musicians who play orchestral instruments: strings (such as violins and cellos), woodwinds (such as flutes and clarinets), brass (such as trumpets and French horns), and percussion (such as the timpani, or kettledrums).

            Most orchestral music is written in one of two forms: a symphony or a concerto. A symphony is a major work, played by the entire orchestra. Most symphonies have two or more parts, called "movements." Some of the best-known classical symphonies have four movements: the first is fast; the second is slow; the third is music for a dance, such as a minuet; and the last movement, or the finale, is fast. A concerto is a musical composition performed by the orchestra and a soloist - who play in dialogue with one another. Most concertos have three movements.

            During the performance, there is a short, silent pause between each movement of a piece. You can determine how many movements there are in a piece, and how many silent pauses there will be, by looking at your program - the movements in each piece will be listed there. Applause is usually reserved for the end of the final movement of the piece, after the conductor has signaled the end of the final note with his or her baton or hand.
